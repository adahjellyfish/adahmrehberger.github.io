<div class="about-text">
     I like to get inspired by my surroundings. My brain connects strange 
     things to design. And that is my favorite part of it. It's important
     to me that the work reflects my clients. You should get to have something
     that represents you. Whether that's a book or an animation, a poster, text,
     a photograph or movie: you get to decide. I am your middleman to make a 
     vision come to live, for you.
